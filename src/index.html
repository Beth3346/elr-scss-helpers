          <h2 class="main-heading">Why I Built Scss Helpers</h2>
          <p>
            This package takes a more functional CSS approach to Scss. Using a
            Scss mixin allows for easy configuration of your base styles to
            ensure that your helpers will match the look and feel of your
            project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since helpers should only be added using a Scss mixin you won't have
            to jump through extra hoops to add configuration. You can also pick
            and choose which helpers to add based on the needs of your project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Which style you choose can depend a lot on your project and your
            needs. A functional CSS approach is beneficial in situations where
            you have a lot of control over your HTML/JSX/Pug... whatever you're
            using to write markup that eventually becomes HTML. Especially if
            you are using a component based framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep in mind that adding non-semantic classes to your HTML will
            result in tightly coupled markup. If your product manager tells you
            that now all headlines should be green instead of blue using style
            classes could make these updates tedious and time consuming. Its for
            this reason that I will not include classes that apply hard coded
            color styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using a more stylesheet based approach is useful when you don't
            necessarily have control over your HTML. Like when you're working
            with a CMS where HTML structure is set in stone or dictated by your
            content team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its also beneficial to use a more stylesheet based approach when you
            are creating traditional HTML/CSS based applications without a
            framework. If you are not creating reusable components you likely
            have a lot of HTML that repeats throughout your site. Using a
            stylesheet based approach with a BEM or similar CSS methodology will
            be much easier to maintain down the road.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes when you are working with a CMS you need to update styles
            quickly and don't have time to update stylesheets. Functional CSS
            classes can allow you to make changes in a few seconds without
            having to update stylesheets and run the build process.
          </p>
          <p>
            I usually find myself using more of a hybrid of these 2 approaches.
            Though I'm leaning towards a more functional approach these days in
            my React and Vue applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep in mind that each project will have its own set of constraints
            and all development tools come with some trade offs. Think about the
            pros and cons of each tool when you are deciding method to use.
          </p>
          <h2 class="main-heading">Whats with this "elr" prefix?</h2>
          <p>
            I have added namespacing to avoid clashes with other frameworks. If
            you don't like the 'elr' prefix you are free to change it.
